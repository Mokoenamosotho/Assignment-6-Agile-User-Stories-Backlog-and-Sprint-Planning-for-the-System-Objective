|-------------|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| **US-001** | As a Database Administrator, I want the system to automatically create backups at predefined intervals so that I can ensure data is not lost due to failures. | Backups must be created at least once every 24 hours; success/failure logs must be generated. | High |
| **US-002** | As an IT Support Staff member, I want the system to predict potential database failures so that I can proactively address issues before they cause downtime. | The system must alert the IT team at least 24 hours before a predicted failure, with 95% accuracy. | High |
| **US-003** | As an IT Support Staff member, I want the system to automatically restore the database from the latest backup in case of failure so that I can minimize downtime and data loss. | Recovery must complete within 30 minutes (RTO), with no data loss exceeding 1 hour (RPO). | High |
| **US-004** | As a Security Officer, I want the system to monitor database activity and detect anomalies so that I can respond quickly to security threats or performance issues. | Alerts must be triggered within 5 minutes of detecting an anomaly, with logs capturing details. | High |
| **US-005** | As a Database Administrator, I want the ability to manually trigger or pause the recovery process so that I can intervene if needed during system failures. | IT staff must be able to initiate or pause recovery via a secure web interface within 10 minutes. | Medium |
| **US-006** | As a Security Officer, I want all backup and recovery processes to use encryption so that patient data remains confidential and secure. | All backup and recovery operations must use AES-256 encryption. | High |
