# Sprint Planning for AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System
## Sprint Goal:
### Implement core AI-driven database recovery functionality, including backup scheduling, failure prediction, and automated recovery processes.

Selected User Stories for Sprint:
1. US-01: As an IT support technician, I want an AI-assisted troubleshooting assistant to guide me through database recovery so that I can resolve issues efficiently.
2. US-09: As an IT administrator, I want AI-driven failure prediction so that I am alerted about potential database failures before they occur.
3. US-05: As an IT administrator, I want the system to self-heal from minor failures so that I can minimize manual intervention.
4. US-06: As a database manager, I want a logging and monitoring framework so that I can track system health and recovery events.
5. US-08: As an auditor, I want all database access and modifications to be logged so that compliance and traceability are ensured.

Task 2.4: Test accuracy of failure prediction model (at least 95%).

User Story 3: US-05 - Self-healing from Minor Failures
Task 3.1: Design self-healing mechanism based on predefined error types.
Task 3.2: Implement auto-recovery for minor database issues (e.g., service restart).
Task 3.3: Create a recovery log for self-healing actions taken.
Task 3.4: Test self-healing functionality for various error scenarios.

User Story 4: US-06 - Logging and Monitoring Framework

Task 4.2: Implement real-time database health tracking (storage, queries, transactions).
Task 4.3: Develop a system for logging database events (failures, recovery actions).
Task 4.4: Test logging and monitoring framework for scalability.

User Story 5: US-08 - Audit and Compliance Logging
Task 5.1: Implement database access and modification logging functionality.
Task 5.2: Design compliance reports for audit purposes.
Task 5.3: Test the audit trail for database access and modifications.
