## 2. Sprint Planning & Sprint Goal Statement

### Sprint Goal: 

The goal of this sprint is to implement core functionalities essential for the AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System. This includes **AI-assisted troubleshooting**, **real-time notifications**, **system failure prediction**, and **automated self-healing** to ensure the system can autonomously address and recover from failures with minimal manual intervention. This sprint will directly contribute to the MVP, allowing IT staff to reduce downtime, predict potential issues, and ensure continuity of services.

## 5. Reflection: Challenges in Translating Requirements to Use Cases/Tests

In developing the user stories, sprint backlog, and test cases, challenges emerged in translating high-level system requirements into actionable user stories and corresponding tests. Ensuring alignment between stakeholder expectations and sprint deliverables was crucial, as some non-functional requirements like scalability and performance needed to be prioritized. Additionally, creating tests for AI-based features, such as failure prediction, posed challenges related to defining concrete success criteria. Balancing these technical complexities while maintaining clarity and traceability was key to successful sprint planning.
