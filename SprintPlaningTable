## Sprint Goal Statement

The sprint goal is to implement the core functionality of the AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System, focusing on the database search API and search functionality. This sprint is critical to the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as it ensures the system can retrieve and display data efficiently through the search interface, which is a key component for the IT support team and system administrators. Successful completion of this sprint will enable the recovery system to deliver essential database information, laying the foundation for future features such as AI-powered failure prediction and automated recovery.
